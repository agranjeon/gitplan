## How to Contribute

Pull Requests (PRs) are the main and exclusive way to contribute to the project.
In order for a PR to be accepted it needs to pass a list of requirements:

- The actual behavior must be correctly explained with natural language and providing a minimum working example in Go that reproduces it.
- In any case, all the PRs have to pass the personal evaluation of at least one of the maintainers of gitplan.
